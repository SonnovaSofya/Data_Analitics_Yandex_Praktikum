# Data_Analitics_Yandex_Praktikum

The repository reveals projects that I have completed as part of the DA educational program by Yandex.Praktikum.

This program gave an opportunity to master the key skills to work as a DA specialist - *Python*, *SQL*, *AB-testing*, *data visualization and creating dashboards*, *ML basics*. Most importantly, working on projects allowed to develop analytical skills for conducting research analysis - identifying patterns, formulating hypotheses and conclusions from the analysed data.
